# Diagrams with Diversity

Please help me improve diversity in how I represent people when teaching Git. You may have suggestions for the actual drawings, for the visual representation of people, or for the naming of files.

These diagrams might be used in print, at face-to-face workshops, online as text-based articles, or as videos. You will be credited in this repository for the contributions you make, but the license does not guarantee you will be credited in all uses of the images in all formats. i.e. please be willing to put your contribution into public domain when submitting your work.

Currently I am focused on *black and white* images which are high contrast, vector-based, and *print-friendly* for the use in the upcoming book, [Git for Teams](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034520.do).

# This is fantastic! How Can I Help?

Here are a few suggestions of what you can do to help:

- Open an issue and tell me what the problem is (ideally describing a better solution).
- Clone the repository and edit the files, then open a pull request with the updated file.
- Clone the respository and make new people! Submit a pull request with your suggestions for new characters.
- Share this repository with others who might be interested in contributing.
